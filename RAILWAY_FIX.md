# 🔧 Railway Deployment Fix

The build error shows Railway's auto-detection (Railpack) couldn't find the right configuration. Let's fix this.

---

## 🎯 Solution: Force Railway to Use Dockerfile

### Option 1: Via Railway Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to your Railway project**
   - https://railway.app/project/your-project

2. **Click on your service**

3. **Go to Settings tab**

4. **Scroll to "Build" section**

5. **Set these values:**
   - **Builder:** `DOCKERFILE`
   - **Dockerfile Path:** `Dockerfile`
   - **Build Command:** (leave empty)

6. **Scroll to "Deploy" section**

7. **Set these values:**
   - **Start Command:** `node server/index.js`
   - **Watch Paths:** (leave empty)

8. **Click "Redeploy" button** at the top

## Option 2: Verify railway.json Exists

The `railway.json` file should already be in your repo. Let me verify and update if needed.

---

## Option 3: Delete and Recreate Service

If the above doesn't work:

1. **Delete the current service** in Railway
2. **Create new service:**
   - Click "New" → "GitHub Repo"
   - Select `rapid-launch-agent`
   - Railway should detect Dockerfile

3. **Add environment variables** (Variables tab):
   ```
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-key
   CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-20250514
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=5000
   ```

4. **Generate domain** (Settings → Networking)

## ✅ What Should Happen

After fixing, you should see:

```
Building with Dockerfile...
Successfully built image
Starting container...
🚀 Rapid Launch Agent server running on port 5000
```

---

## 🐛 Why This Happened

Railway's auto-detection (Railpack) sometimes fails when:
- Repository structure is ambiguous
- Multiple language files present
- Dockerfile not detected initially

**Solution:** Explicitly tell Railway to use Docker.

---

## 📝 Railway Configuration Files

Your repo has:
- ✅ `Dockerfile` - Docker build instructions
- ✅ `railway.json` - Railway config
- ✅ `railway.toml` - Alternative config

If Railway still doesn't detect it, use Option 1 above.

**After fixing, the build should succeed!** 🚀
