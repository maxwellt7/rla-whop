```

Copy the `orgId` value to GitHub Secrets as `VERCEL_ORG_ID`

## üìã Complete Secrets List

Once configured, you should have these 7 secrets:

```
‚úÖ VERCEL_TOKEN
‚úÖ VERCEL_ORG_ID
‚úÖ VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
‚úÖ VITE_API_URL
‚úÖ RAILWAY_TOKEN
‚úÖ RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID
‚úÖ RAILWAY_URL
```

## üîÑ Testing Secrets

After adding all secrets, test the workflows:

### Method 1: Push to main
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Test deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Method 2: Manual trigger
1. Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub
2. Select a workflow (e.g., "Deploy Frontend to Vercel")
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select branch: `main`
5. Click "Run workflow"

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Secret not found" error

**Solution:** 
- Check secret name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Verify secret is set in correct repository
- Wait a few minutes after adding secrets

### Vercel deployment fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test locally first
vercel login
vercel --prod

# If successful, the token is valid
# Check VERCEL_ORG_ID and VERCEL_PROJECT_ID match
```

### Railway deployment fails

**Solution:**
```bash
# Test locally first
railway login
railway up

# If successful, the token is valid
# Check RAILWAY_SERVICE_ID is correct
```

## üîí Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **Never commit secrets to Git**
‚úÖ **Rotate tokens regularly** (every 90 days recommended)
‚úÖ **Use separate tokens for CI/CD** (don't use personal tokens)
‚úÖ **Review token permissions** (minimum required only)
‚úÖ **Monitor token usage** in Vercel/Railway dashboards
‚úÖ **Revoke tokens immediately** if compromised

---

## üîÑ Rotating Secrets

If you need to rotate/update secrets:

1. **Create new token** in Vercel/Railway
2. **Update GitHub Secret** with new value
3. **Revoke old token** in Vercel/Railway
4. **Test deployment** to verify

---

## üìä Workflow Permissions

The workflows also need these permissions (should be set automatically):

- **Vercel Workflow:** `contents: read`
- **Railway Workflow:** `contents: read`
- **CI Workflow:** `contents: read`, `security-events: write`
