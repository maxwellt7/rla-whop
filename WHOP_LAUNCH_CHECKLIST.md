cd /Users/maxmayes/Downloads/rapid-launch-agent-whop
npm install
npm run server
# Visit http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### Test Frontend Locally
```bash
cd /Users/maxmayes/Downloads/rapid-launch-agent-whop
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.whop -t rapid-launch-agent-whop .

## ðŸ“Š Important URLs

- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/maxwellt7/rla-whop
- **Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **Whop Developer Dashboard**: https://whop.com/dashboard/developer
- **Your App Dashboard**: https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/apps/app_RsMn7IKRAMfuhN

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

1. **Environment Variables**: Make sure all environment variables are set correctly in both Railway and Vercel
2. **CORS**: The backend is configured to accept requests from any origin. You may want to restrict this in production.
3. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring early
4. **Testing**: Test thoroughly before submitting to the App Store
5. **Backup**: Keep your environment variables in a secure password manager

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Backend not responding
- Check Railway logs
- Verify environment variables
- Check if Anthropic API key is valid

### Authentication not working
- Verify redirect URI matches in both Whop dashboard and backend
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Whop SDK is properly initialized

### Frontend can't reach backend
- Check VITE_API_URL environment variable
- Verify backend is deployed and running
- Check CORS configuration
